# My Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to allow myself to have an easier time throughout my bootcamp experience, and hopefully others.  This webpage should allow for ease of access to plenty of notes about HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript.  Through this project it allowed me to see how functions are used, try it out!

You can also use Chrome Dev Tools by right clicking your mouse on the webpage and navigating to inspect.  From there you should see the console tab.  You will see a list of topics that were covered in the prework and a random study topic! Enjoy!
